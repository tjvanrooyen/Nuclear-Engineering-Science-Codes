# Nuclear Engineering Science Codes

## Project Context
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for nuclear engineering calculations, particularly focused on neutron physics, reactor physics, and fuel analysis.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use descriptive variable names related to nuclear engineering terminology
- Include units in comments and variable names where applicable
- Document all equations with references to nuclear engineering textbooks or standards

## Common Nuclear Engineering Conventions
- Use SI units unless specified otherwise
- Standard nuclear constants should reference CODATA or NIST values
- Include proper error handling for physical calculations
- Add docstrings explaining the physics behind calculations

## Dependencies
- NumPy for numerical calculations
- SciPy for scientific computing
- Matplotlib for plotting
- Pandas for data analysis
- Jupyter for interactive notebooks
